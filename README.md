# flash-easy-boulders

Amaze your friends and flash boulders on the kilter board far above your grade which accoring to the model are graded too high

## Problems
Some boulders are not shown in the KilterBoard app even tough they are listed in the database. Before I find a solution, you just need to try and see which are there.

## Usage

1. Install requirements pip install -r requirements.txt 
2. Run train.py to train the model
3. Run predict.py to get N too highly graded boulders
